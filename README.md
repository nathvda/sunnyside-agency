## Welcome to my repository.
This repository has been made in order for me to challenge my coding skills and learn more about reponsive design and positionning. I will be exploring the possibilities of HTML, CSS and SASS.

This time, the deadline for finishing the project is **November 24th in the morning**. I will be working on my own on this project.

## More informations about the versions.

**Version 2** (2022/11/23) —

- Fixed the margin and made it impossible for the text to stretch for the whole width of the screen. 
- Fixed a few more alignment issues and padding struggles.
- Improved responsiveness.
- Fixed image for the ratio to remain the same in desktop version.

**Version 1** (2022/11/22) — 

The basic HTML and CSS structures have been added, as well as the animations for the links. the HTML and CSS still need to be commented and refactored to allow for greated readibility. I made use of variables to allow for an easier modification of the colors, as well as a few mixins in SASS to reduce the line mount in the Sass file. I also tried to use the BEM methodology for naming the elements that were not nested into one another.
